TALAR is based upon the [Fedora Commons Repository](https://duraspace.org/fedora/ "Go to Duraspace"), v4.xy.
The repository provides an [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/ "Go to protocol specification")-based interface to metadata harvesting. Its metadata content is harvested by various partners, including the CLARIN [Virtual Language Observatory](https://vlo.clarin.eu "Go to the VLO").

* The [Tuebingen Language Resources as catalogued in the VLO](https://vlo.clarin.eu/search?3&fq=collection:T%C3%BCbingen+Language+Resources&fqType=collection:or "See Resources in the VLO")

TALAR is capable of exporting its CMDI-based metadata to the following formats:

* from [CMDI to Dublin Core](http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/converter/Cmdi2DC/ "Goto CMDI-DC Converter")
* from [CMDI to MARC 21](http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/converter/Cmdi2Marc/ "Goto CMDI-MARC21 Converter")
* from CMDI to HTML (used in the Web GUI of TALAR)
