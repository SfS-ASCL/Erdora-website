The TÃ¼bingen Archive of Language Resources ([TALAR](https://talar.sfb833.uni-tuebingen.de:8443/erdora/ "Enter Repository")) hosts language-related research data from three main data providers:

### Data archives

* SFB 833: "The Construction of Meaning: The Dynamics and Adaptivity of Linguistic Structures"

* SFB 441: "Linguistic Data Structures"

* SFB 632: "Information structure: The linguistic means for structuring utterances, sentences and
texts" (University of Potsdam, Humboldt-University Berlin, Free University Berlin)

Though the archive management follows an **open research and open access policy**, some data sets
are restricted due to the rights of third parties, including publishers and informants.

This repository has been awarded the [Data Seal of Approval](http://www.datasealofapproval.org "Go to the Data Seal of Approval WebSite") in 2013 and 2015.
